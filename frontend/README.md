## Design & Analytical Questions

Please include answers in your `README.md`:

1. **Architecture Decisions**  
   What were your main considerations when structuring your code?

2. **API Design**  
   How did you decide what the API should look like? Did you consider versioning or error formats?

3. **State Management (If implemented)**  
   If you implemented frontend, how is state handled on the frontend? Why did you choose that approach?

4. **Security (If implemented)**  
   If you implemented login/auth, how did you handle token storage and validation?

5. **Scalability & Maintainability**  
   If this project grew to support teams and thousands of users, what changes would you make?

6. **Time Constraints**  
   What features did you intentionally skip due to time constraints?
